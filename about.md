We’re doing a bad job at democracy. We get warped by misinformation and treat each other like enemies, or become so sick of it all that we disconnect.

civicly is an experiment in rebuilding.

The idea is simple: connect Americans for 1:1 conversations about our country, via text message.

## What?

Here’s the thinking—

The internet should be democracy’s best friend. It gives anyone with a connection a voice.

But this has led to a lot of noise. Some of us learned that the easiest way to be heard is to be LOUD. Others of us stopped speaking altogether.

And it’s led to fragmentation and isolation. With so many voices to choose from, we can filter out anything we don’t want to hear.

What we need is a place where we can be heard, and where we agree to listen. (Even when we don’t like what we hear.)

civicly is that place.

## So how does it work?

  - You sign up via text message.
  - civicly randomly connects you with another American (without revealing your phone number).
  - Over the next four days, you text each other, citizen to citizen. You’ll have a prompt to get you started, but the rest is up to you.
  - At the end of the round, the conversation ends.
  - The next round begins, and you’re connected to a new person with different experiences and different ideas.

## …what would I talk about with a random person?

Well, they aren’t entirely random. You’re both citizens of the same democracy. That’s a serious bond.

So, one obvious question to ask would be—

  > “How are we doing, as a country?”

Of course, you could also start specific, and ask for their take on a particular issue or event. Maybe you’ll agree 100%. More likely, you’ll have some differences to explore.

The point is, Americans have something to talk to each other about: our country.

And, if we want to function as a democracy, we need to start doing it again.
