We’ve become too divided as a country.

civicly is a place for any American who believes we can do better.

The idea is simple: Connect Americans for 1:1 conversations about our country, via
text message. Here’s how it works:

  - One 1:1 conversation at a time
  - Each conversation lasts 4 days
  - Your conversations are sent through civicly’s phone number
  - civicly starts and ends the conversations for you

Joining is a commitment to be two things: civic and civil.

The purpose of a conversation is simply to share your thoughts with your conversation
partner, and to listen to their thoughts in turn. Every American has a different
background and a unique perspective. And we all want our country to succeed.

We have everything to gain by talking with one another.
