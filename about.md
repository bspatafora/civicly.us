We’ve become too divided as a country.

civicly is a place for any American who thinks we can do better.

The idea is simple: Connect Americans for 1:1 conversations about our country, over
text message. Here’s how it works:

  - 1 conversation at a time
  - Each conversation lasts 4 days
  - Every conversation happens via text messages that you and your partner both send
    to civicly’s phone number
  - civicly starts and ends the conversations for you

Joining is a commitment to be two things: civic and civil.

The purpose of a conversation is to share your thoughts with your conversation partner,
and to listen to their thoughts in turn. Every American has a different background and
a unique perspective. And we all want our country to succeed.

We have everything to gain by talking with one another.
