Welcome to civicly! Here’s everything you need to get started.

## How does this work?

  - One 1:1 conversation at a time
  - Each conversation lasts 4 days
  - Your conversations are sent through civicly’s phone number
  - civicly starts and ends the conversations for you

## What should I do now?

First, add civicly to your contacts. The number is the same one you received your
welcome text message from: (630) 776-0985.

Then, just sit tight! When the next round of conversations starts, you’ll get a text
from civicly that will read something like this:

> [civicly] Welcome to round 1. Say hello to Ben S! Here's a question: How are we
doing, as a country?

Once you see the start message, you’re connected to your partner. For the next four
days, any texts you send to civicly will be forwarded on to your partner (and vice versa).
At the end of the four days, you’ll get another text informing you that the round is over
and that you have been disconnected from your partner.

## Anything else I should know?

By using civicly, you agree to the [terms][] and [privacy policy][]. Please read through
them—they’re shorter than most. The terms include a “civic pact” to be mindful of during
your conversations.

You can text the word “STOP” to civicly to delete your account. It must be typed all-caps,
as shown. This is immediate and permanent, so don’t send it unless you mean it!

Finally—civicly is an experiment. It’s going to change over time, and there may be bugs
along the way. If you experience any, please let me know. More importantly, if you have
an idea about how to make civicly better, or just want to share your experience, please
don’t hesitate to. You can reach me at ben@civicly.us
