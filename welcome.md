By joining civicly, you affirm the very idea of democracy. Thanks for taking the risk and deciding to put in the work.

You also affirm you agree to the [terms][] and [privacy policy][]. Unlike most others, they’re meant to be read, so please do read them.

This page describes civicly in more detail.

## Rounds

  - civicly works in rounds. A round lasts four days. You’re connected for a 1:1 conversation with a new person each round.
  - When a new round begins, you’ll receive a text message introducing you to your conversation partner.
  - You and your partner will see each other’s names (e.g., Ben S), but not phone numbers.
  - To talk to your partner, you send messages to civicly’s number, (630) 776-0985. The messages are automatically relayed to your partner’s phone.

## Commands

  - At any time, you can send the special commands HELP and STOP. Each must be typed in all caps and with no spaces.
  - HELP responds with some helpful info, and STOP deletes your account. STOP is immediate and permanent, so don’t send it unless you mean it.
  - Commands that you send won’t be forwarded to your partner.

## civicly is an experiment

  - If you have an idea to make it better, please share it!
  - If you notice a bug, please share it!
  - If something interesting happened in your conversation, share that too!
  - You can email me at ben@civicly.us

## Miscellaneous

  - Messages that you send are stored. I’m probably going to peruse (and eventually data-process) them to help figure out how to make civicly better. Just wanted to be upfront about this.
  - If you haven’t already, please add (630) 776-0985 to your phone’s contacts under “civicly”.
  - civicly is for dialog. Pictures and video messages are not supported. (Emoji are fair game, though!)

## Finally, a few reminders

  - Attacking evokes defensiveness; better to ask, listen, offer.
  - We can't get better if we're shut.
  - Fortune favors the bold and curious.
