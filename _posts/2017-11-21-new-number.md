If you’re here, you’re probably wondering why civicly’s number just changed. What
was wrong with the old one?

Here’s the short answer: Have you ever received a long text that was broken up into
smaller pieces? Possibly in the wrong order? **The new number fixes that.** (For
some users.)

If you’re one of the lucky users, civicly just got a little nicer to use! When your
conversation partner sends a long message, you’ll receive it as a single text
(making out-of-order delivery a thing of the past).

But why couldn't this issue be fixed for everyone? And who are the “lucky” users?

The nature of the issue is this: Some wireless carriers support long texts (AT&T,
T-Mobile), and some don’t (Sprint, Verizon\*). Whether you actually *see* support
for long texts in a given conversation depends on both (a) your carrier, and (b)
the carrier of the person you’re texting with. If you and your friend are both on
AT&T, your long messages to each other will be delivered as single texts. If
you’re both on Sprint, they’ll be broken up (and possibly out of order). This will
also be the case if one of you is on AT&T and the other on Sprint.

civicly’s first number was on Sprint. The new one uses either AT&T or T-Mobile,
depending on which has a stronger signal. The effect of this is to enable users on
carriers who support long texts to enjoy that functionality, when it’s available
(i.e., when their conversation partner is also on such a carrier).

**So: If you’re on AT&T or T-Mobile, you’ll now see support for long texts in some
of your civicly conversations** (again, depending on what network your partner is
on).

I wish there were a way to make this work for all users all of the time. But
it’s up each carrier to decide whether to implement support for long texts (the
technical term for this is “concatenated SMS”). Unless or until all of them do,
there isn’t a way to make this happen.
