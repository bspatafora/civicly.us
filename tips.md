Here are 5 tips for getting the most out of civicly.

For more info, including the basics, there’s also an [F.A.Q.][]

### 1. Say hello!

Simple, but powerful.

### 2. Ask a question

civicly sends you a prompt at the beginning of your conversation, but this is just
a starting point. Never hesitate to ask your partner for their thoughts on
something. The world is a complicated place, and we can only make sense of it
together.

### 3. Go for understanding

Civic conversation can prompt disagreement. This is OK! Disagreement is a feature
of democracy, and it doesn’t have to lead to a fight. When it happens, make it
your goal to understand what your partner thinks (not what you think they think)
and *why* they think it. Wouldn’t you ask the same of them?

And remember—at the end of the day, we’re all on the same team!

### 4. Reply on your time

civicly should never feel like a burden. If you can’t respond to a message right
away, that’s OK! We all have different schedules. Think of your partner a little
like a pen pal—there will usually be some delay in getting back to one another.

### 5. Stick with it

civicly is less about any one conversation, and much more about the cumulative
effect of all the conversations you will have over time.
