Here are some tips for getting the most out of civicly.

### Ask questions!

civicly sends out questions and news headlines to help things along but, ultimately,
what you get out of a conversation is up to you. Don’t hesitate to ask your partner
for their take on something in the news, or their thoughts on a particular issue.

Make it your goal to learn one thing from every person you talk to.

### Go for understanding

If you find you disagree with someone, don’t immediately start trying to change
their view. It’s essential to first try to *understand* their view (after all,
you’re asking them to try to understand yours). Ask questions.

Make sure you listen to what your partner is saying rather than sticking to
assumptions about what they think and why.

### Reply on your time

If you’re feeling overwhelmed by civicly, you’re doing it wrong! It’s okay not to
respond to every message as soon as you receive it. We all have our own lives and
our own schedules. Think of you and your conversation partner a little like pen
pals—there may be a delay in getting back to each other. When you get a message,
make a mental note to respond to it when you have a few minutes of downtime.

Figure out how civicly fits into your schedule.

### Stick with it

civicly is less about what happens in any one conversation, and more about the belief
that our democracy would be strengthened if we all made a habit of having small,
serendipitous civic conversations with our fellow citizens.

And remember: At the end of the day, we’re all on the same team.
